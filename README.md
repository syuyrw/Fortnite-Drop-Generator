Fortnite Random Drop Generator (Jordans Version)

Description: I created this project because I was inspired by this project by @ImBaedin on GitHub: https://www.braedin.com/FortniteRandomDrop/

I wanted to build off of his concept. The first thing that I wanted to add was the ability to make it so that you could generate a random POI instead of just a completely random location on the map. I often play with some of my friends, so it is more helpful to drop at a named location rather than a completely random point.

The program is simple to use. All you have to do is either click the "Generate Drop" button to generate a random POI drop, or click "Random Spot" to generate a completely random point.

@Tweagan11 implemented the completely random location generator, and also helped with the debugging for this project. Huge thanks to him.

Technologies: This programs UI was built using HTML and CSS and the program itsself was built in Javascript.

Issues faced: I initially built this program so that clicking on the Generate Drop button refreshed the page, and refreshing the page generates a new location. This was a quick coding solution, but it caused issues with loading new locations, and them loading in the correct locations. It was then change by @Tweagan11 so that clicking the button did not reload the page, and instead generated a new location, and removed the old one.

Future Features: 
- I am going to make it so instead of there being two buttons, there will just be one button, and a switch that the user can flip to switch between generating random POI, and generating random point on map.
- I will also implement a feature that tracks and displays the total number of locations generated globally.
